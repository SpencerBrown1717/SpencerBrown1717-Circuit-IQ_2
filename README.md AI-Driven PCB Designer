# SpencerBrown1717-Circuit-IQ_2
# AI-Driven PCB Designer (MVP)

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an AI-driven PCB design system that automatically generates PCB designs from component datasheets and textual requirements.

## Features

- Upload component datasheets (PDF or text)
- Describe circuit requirements in natural language
- Automatic component parameter extraction
- Automatic component placement and routing
- Gerber file generation for manufacturing
- 2D and 3D PCB previews
- Gerber file export for simulation/manufacturing

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- PyPDF2
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy
- spaCy
- transformers (optional, for advanced datasheet processing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-pcb-designer.git
cd ai-pcb-designer
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements File (requirements.txt)
```
Flask==2.0.1
PyPDF2==2.10.6
Pillow==9.0.0
numpy==1.22.0
spacy==3.4.0
transformers==4.24.0
torch==1.13.0
werkzeug==2.0.2
```

4. Download the spaCy model
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

3. Use the interface to:
   - Upload component datasheets (or paste text)
   - Describe your circuit requirements
   - Set PCB parameters
   - Generate your PCB design

## Usage Workflow

1. **Input Component Data**:
   - Upload PDF datasheets or paste information about components
   - Add as many components as needed for your design

2. **Describe Requirements**:
   - Explain what you want the circuit to do
   - Specify any special requirements (power, connections, etc.)
   - The AI will add necessary components if they're missing

3. **Set Board Parameters**:
   - Define board dimensions
   - Choose number of layers
   - Set trace width and clearance values

4. **Generate Design**:
   - Click "Generate PCB Design" button
   - Wait while the AI processes your inputs
   - View the generated PCB design preview

5. **Export or Simulate**:
   - Download individual Gerber files or all files as a ZIP archive
   - Open in a simulator or send to a manufacturer

## Limitations of the MVP

- Limited component types and parameters
- Simple auto-routing without optimization
- Basic design rule checking
- Simplified Gerber file generation
- Limited 3D visualization
- No electrical simulation

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced AI for schematic generation from requirements
- Improved component placement algorithms
- Advanced auto-routing with signal integrity consideration
- Integration with real-time DRC (Design Rule Checking)
- Full 3D modeling of components and board
- Electrical simulation integration
- Support for more complex multi-layer designs
- Cloud-based processing for faster generation
- Machine learning for design optimization
